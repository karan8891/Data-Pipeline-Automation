## Data Pipeline: Pub/Sub to BigQuery (.md format)

This document describes the data pipeline that ingests data from a Pub/Sub topic and stores it in a BigQuery table. 

### Text Explanation

The pipeline follows these steps:

1. **Data Ingestion (Pub/Sub):**
   - A Python script simulates data generation using a predefined schema (located in `data_schema.py`).
   - The script publishes messages containing fake data (name, age, city) to a designated Pub/Sub topic.

2. **Dataflow Transformation (Optional):**
   - A Dataflow pipeline can be implemented for data transformation tasks like filtering or enrichment.
   - This example omits the transformation step for simplicity.

3. **Data Storage (BigQuery):**
   - The data, either transformed (if Dataflow is used) or original, is written to a BigQuery table. This can be done directly by the Pub/Sub subscriber or through the Dataflow pipeline.

**Explanation:**

* `Start`: Represents the starting point of the data pipeline.
* `Data Generation (Python Script)`: Simulates data generation with a schema defined in `data_schema.py`.
* `Data Schema (data_schema.py)`: Defines the data structure for messages (connected by a solid line to `Data Generation`).
* `Pub/Sub Topic (your-topic-name)`: The Pub/Sub topic where messages are published (connected by a solid line to `Data Generation`).
* `(Optional) Dataflow Transformation`: Represents an optional step for data manipulation (connected by a dashed line to `Pub/Sub Topic`).
* `BigQuery Table (your-dataset.your-table)`: The BigQuery table where the data is stored (connected by a solid line to `Pub/Sub Topic` or `Dataflow Transformation`).
* `End`: Represents the completion point of the data pipeline.

**Note:**

* Replace `your-topic-name`, `your-dataset`, and `your-table` with your actual names.
* The dashed line indicates that Dataflow transformation is an optional step.

## Airflow Integration Explanation

This document explains how the provided code snippet can be used with Apache Airflow to orchestrate your data pipeline built in Project 1.

### Benefits of using Airflow

The code demonstrates how to integrate the Python functions you created in Project 1 with an Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). Here's a breakdown of the advantages this integration offers:

* **Orchestration:** Airflow schedules and manages the execution order of tasks, automating the entire data pipeline.
* **Automation:** The DAG defines the task dependencies (`publish_task` -> `transform_task` -> `load_task`), automating the entire data flow.
* **Reusability:** The code from project 1 (functions like `publish_messages` and `transform_data`) is reused within the Airflow operators, making your code modular.
* **Scheduling:** The `schedule_interval` parameter (in this example, @hourly) allows you to run the pipeline automatically on an hourly basis (adjust this as needed).
* **Monitoring:** Airflow provides a web interface to monitor the status of your DAG runs, track task successes/failures, and view logs.

Essentially, this code snippet leverages Airflow to transform your Python functions from project 1 into a scheduled, automated data pipeline. Airflow takes care of the execution order, scheduling, and monitoring, making your data processing reliable and manageable.
